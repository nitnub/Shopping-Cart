Small functional and styling enhancements were made beyond the original requirements, including the following:
* Updated the individual product listing styling.
* Consolidated all like-products to a single entry in the checkout area. Each entry contains a count of items and total price for that item type.
* Updated the individual product listing styling.
* (Note the addition of a stock image query for all images was a part of the original requirements list)
