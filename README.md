Small functional and styling enhancements were made beyond the original requirements, including the following:
* Updated the individual product listing styling.
* Consolidated all like-products to a single entry in the checkout area. Each entry contains a count of items and total price for that item type.
* Updated the individual product listing styling.
* (Note the addition of a stock image query for all images was a part of the original requirements list)


## Installation & Dependencies
To install, download all files and run index.html from a local server. 
* Utilization of the restock functionality will require the use of a local CMS, like [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), on port 1337. 
* To utilize the Restock Products field, create a table with the below populated fields.
